## üèóÔ∏è ECOSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### TIER 1: FOUNDATION SERVICES (Phase 1 - Priority)
Essential services that form the backbone of the entire ecosystem.

#### 1. codai.ro - Central Platform & AIDE Hub

Use the name AIDE for your AI meta-agent and development environment.

Possibly publish and host the AIDE tools and assistant experience.

Offer developer-centric utilities (e.g., frameworks, agents, SDKs).

GitHub: [codai](https://github.com/codai-ecosystem/codai)

This is where AIDE is presented as landing page and the actual app for AIDE would be reachable from aide.codai.ro. I would also like to have status.codai.ro where anyoane can see the status of the services also the history of breakdowns. AIDE can be copied from https://github.com/dragoscv/AIDE into https://github.com/codai-ecosystem/AIDE

API Gateway: Exposes all Codai app APIs via api.codai.ro for third-party integrations.
CDN Gateway: Use cdn.codai.ro for CDN

What is codai.ro?
codai.ro is an AI-native development environment that makes coding as simple as having a conversation. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, build software by describing what you want - our AI handles the complexity.

‚ú® Why codai.ro?

I want local.memorai.ro to act as a dashboard for the localhost memorai mcp server if it's running otherwise it will show a page with instructions on how to turn on the mcp server. I want mcp.memorai.ro to be the endpoint for the memorai mcp cloud tool.
We will use memorai.ro as database for our codai ecosystem, but users could also rent database and mcp tool for their projects, with all the tools and SDKs and accessing posibilities for all programming languages with highest enterprise AI security. I want complete dashboard for all database tools and mcp, with all configurations available.
