# üöÄ Final Deployment Instructions

## üìã Current Configuration

- **GitHub Repository**: Personal account `dragoscv/AIDE`
- **NPM Packages**: Organization `@codai` on npmjs.com
- **Branch**: `aide-main`
- **Latest Commit**: `e24c89cc7f6`

## üéØ Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `AIDE`
3. Owner: `dragoscv` (your personal account)
4. Description: `codai.ro - AI-native development environment for web and native`
5. Make it Public
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run this command:

```bash
git push -u origin aide-main
```

### 3. Publish NPM Packages

#### Prerequisites

- Ensure you're logged into npm: `npm whoami`
- Verify @codai organization exists: `npm org ls codai`
- If organization doesn't exist: `npm org create codai`

#### Publication Commands

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Memory Graph Package
cd packages/memory-graph
npm publish --access public

# 2. Agent Runtime Package
cd ../agent-runtime
npm publish --access public

# 3. UI Components Package
cd ../ui-components
npm publish --access public
```

#### Verify Publication
