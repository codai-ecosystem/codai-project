## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Cleanup ✅

- [x] Removed `secrets/aide-dev-461602-37d8be2d8a83.json`
- [x] Removed `secrets/aide-github-app.2025-05-31.private-key.pem`
- [x] Replaced actual Stripe test keys with placeholders in:
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh`
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.ps1`
  - `scripts/setup-vercel-env.bat`

### 2. Enhanced Security Measures ✅

- [x] Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive secret pattern protection
- [x] Added patterns for:

  - API keys (`*api-key*`, `*secret-key*`)
  - SSH keys (`id_rsa*`, `*.ssh`)
  - SSL certificates (`*.crt`, `*.cert`)
  - OAuth configs (`oauth-*.json`, `client-secret*.json`)

## Required Follow-up Actions

### URGENT - Within 24 Hours ⚠️

- [ ] **Rotate Google Cloud Service Account Key**
  - Access Google Cloud Console for project `aide-dev-461602`
  - Generate new service account key for `aide-deployer@aide-dev-461602.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Update deployment systems with new credentials
  - Store new credentials securely (environment variables, not files)

- [ ] **Review Google Cloud Activity**
  - Login to Google Cloud Console
  - Review activity logs for any unauthorized access
  - Check billing for unexpected charges
  - Review IAM permissions and access

- [ ] **Audit Repository History**
  - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan entire git history
  - Consider using `git filter-branch` to remove secrets from history if needed
  - Review all commits that touched the `secrets/` directory

### Within 1 Week

- [ ] **Implement Secrets Management**
  - Set up proper secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
  - Configure CI/CD to use secure secret injection
  - Remove all hardcoded secrets from codebase

## URGENT ACTION ITEMS - GOOGLE CLOUD ESCALATION ⚠️

  - Create new service account key for `aide-deployer@aide-dev-461602.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Update all deployment systems with new credentials
  - Verify disabled key is fully revoked

- [ ] **Review GCP Account Activity**
  - Login to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=jsonPayload.@type%3D%22type.googleapis.com%2Fgoogle.cloud.abuseevent.logging.v1.AbuseEvent%22;project=aide-dev-461602

  - Review project resources and permissions

- [ ] **Stripe Key Rotation**
  - Rotate any Stripe test keys that may have been exposed
  - Update deployment configurations with new keys
  - Verify webhook endpoints are secure

- [ ] **Repository History Audit**
  - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan entire repository history
  - Check for any other exposed secrets in previous commits
  - Consider using `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove sensitive data from history

### Medium Priority Actions (Within 48 Hours)

- [ ] **Implement Secret Management**
  - Set up proper secret management system (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, etc.)
  - Remove all hardcoded credentials from configuration files
  - Update deployment pipelines to use secret management

- [ ] **Security Audit**
