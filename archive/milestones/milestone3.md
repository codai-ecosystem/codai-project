2. **Limited CI/CD Coverage**: Only 3/29 services have automated workflows
3. **Test Implementation**: Frameworks exist but zero actual test coverage
4. **Kubernetes Manifests**: Incomplete deployment configurations
5. **Performance Monitoring**: No APM, load testing, or performance optimization
6. **Disaster Recovery**: No backup, recovery, or high availability strategy

#### Production Operations Gaps

1. **Observability**: Limited distributed tracing and metrics collection
2. **Security Implementation**: Framework exists but needs full deployment
3. **Service Mesh**: No inter-service communication management
4. **Auto-scaling**: No horizontal/vertical pod autoscaling configured
5. **Secret Management**: No enterprise secret rotation and management
6. **Compliance Automation**: Security scanning and compliance checking missing
