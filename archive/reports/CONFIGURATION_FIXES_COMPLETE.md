## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### 1. **Build Pipeline Optimization** (Low Priority)

- Some apps experience module resolution issues in full build
- Next.js worker process intermittent failures
- PNPM binary warnings (non-blocking)

### 2. **Business Logic Implementation** (High Priority)

- **Priority 1**: logai authentication service needs implementation
- **Priority 2**: bancai and wallet financial services need development
- **Priority 3**: Template services need business logic

### 3. **Production Readiness** (Medium Priority)

- CI/CD pipeline setup pending
- Deployment infrastructure needs configuration
- Monitoring and observability setup required

---

## 🚀 Next Steps Recommendation

### Immediate (Next 7 Days):

1. **Complete logai service** - Authentication hub implementation
2. **Resolve publicai build issue** - Next.js configuration optimization
3. **Begin bancai development** - Financial platform foundation

### Short Term (Next 30 Days):

1. **Implement CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
2. **Complete all template services** - Business logic implementation
3. **Set up production infrastructure** - Domain configuration and hosting

### Long Term (Next 90 Days):

1. **Launch production environment** - Full ecosystem deployment
2. **Implement monitoring** - Observability and performance tracking
3. **Scale development** - Multi-agent parallel development
